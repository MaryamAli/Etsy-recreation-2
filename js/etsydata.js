My pocket Scarves offer many diverse fabrics and most of them are available as cravats also, so long as I have enough fabric in stock. This fabric has been pre-washed for shrinkage. This ascot is approx. 42&quot; long and is pleated at the neck.\n\nOf course Bluebell and the Fox will fall in love with this fox print! Very refreshing print on French pale blue.\n\nThis ascot\/cravat comes with a charming, self-produced post card with a little preamble about the pocket scarf.\n\nPlease read all shipping policies before purchase and if you live in a country outside of the USA familiarize yourself with your customs and excise taxes.\n\nA cravat is worn around the neck and tucked under a sweater or a shirt and were highly fashionable in plain colors and came in a variety of shapes and sizes. Like the pocket scarbes I enclose a post card with a little history of the neck scarf. It can be tied or folded over itself and wlll certainly keep a neck warmer than without. I&#39;m all for cozy! This unusual print adds an edgy modern twist and a tip of the hat for the old, in this redux vintage man&#39;s or woman&#39;s accessory. This cravat\/ascot is double sided and the fabric split so that the ravens stay upright and half are not upside down when wrapped around the neck. It is pleated in the back. \n\nSolid colors are also available.\n\nHand wash is advised, cold water. If placed in a washing bag this can be washed in the machine on cold, line dried and pressed with an iron. Dryers take the color out of cottons, so I do not recommend that.  \n\nGift wrapping is available at no extra cost upon request.\n\nTo see behind the scenes photos from Bluebell and the Fox please feel free to visit the Facebook Page: https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/pages\/Bluebell-and-the-Fox\/483580898346623","creation_tsz":1444712247,"ending_tsz":1455343047,"original_creation_tsz":1434049503,"last_modified_tsz":1444712247,"price":"38.00","currency_code":"USD","quantity":1,"tags":["Cravat","Ascot","Mens Scarf","Mens Accessory","Unusual Gift Idea","Dark Ascot","Gift for Man Him","Gothic Cravat Ascot","Warlock Clothing","Warlock Ascot","Trees Ascot","Black Blue Gray"],"category_path":["Accessories","Scarf"],"category_path_ids":[69150467,68892184],"materials":["Cotton"],"shop_section_id":16434213,"featured_rank":null,"state_tsz":1444677049,"url":"https:\/\/www.etsy.com\/listing\/236744966\/little-red-foxes-beau-brummel-cravat-or?utm_source=theironyardteaching&utm_medium=api&utm_campaign=api","views":25,"num_favorers":1,"shipping_template_id":null,"processing_min":3,"processing_max":5,"who_made":"i_did","is_supply":"false","when_made":"made_to_order","item_weight":null,"item_weight_units":null,"item_length":null,"item_width":null,"item_height":null,"item_dimensions_unit":"in","is_private":false,"recipient":"unisex_adults","occasion":null,"style":["Retro","Goth"],"non_taxable":false,"is_customizable":true,"is_digital":false,"file_data":"","language":"en-US","has_variations":false,"taxonomy_id":46,"taxonomy_path":["Accessories","Scarves & Wraps","Scarves"],"used_manufacturer":false,"Images":[{"listing_image_id":785963242,"hex_code":"000000","red":0,"green":0,"blue":0,"hue":0,"saturation":0,"brightness":0,"is_black_and_white":null,"creation_tsz":1434049504,"listing_id":236744966,"rank":1,"url_75x75":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/066\/0\/7502807\/il_75x75.785963242_gwsg.jpg","url_170x135":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/066\/0\/7502807\/il_170x135.785963242_gwsg.jpg","url_570xN":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/066\/0\/7502807\/il_570xN.785963242_gwsg.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/066\/0\/7502807\/il_fullxfull.785963242_gwsg.jpg","full_height":783,"full_width":570},{"listing_image_id":785668229,"hex_code":"000000","red":0,"green":0,"blue":0,"hue":0,"saturation":0,"brightness":0,"is_black_and_white":null,"creation_tsz":1434049504,"listing_id":236744966,"rank":2,"url_75x75":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/063\/0\/7502807\/il_75x75.785668229_g6rn.jpg","url_170x135":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/063\/0\/7502807\/il_170x135.785668229_g6rn.jpg","url_570xN":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/063\/0\/7502807\/il_570xN.785668229_g6rn.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/063\/0\/7502807\/il_fullxfull.785668229_g6rn.jpg","full_height":747,"full_width":570},{"listing_image_id":785668321,"hex_code":"000000","red":0,"green":0,"blue":0,"hue":0,"saturation":0,"brightness":0,"is_black_and_white":null,"creation_tsz":1434049504,"listing_id":236744966,"rank":3,"url_75x75":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/061\/0\/7502807\/il_75x75.785668321_f1bw.jpg","url_170x135":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/061\/0\/7502807\/il_170x135.785668321_f1bw.jpg","url_570xN":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/061\/0\/7502807\/il_570xN.785668321_f1bw.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/061\/0\/7502807\/il_fullxfull.785668321_f1bw.jpg","full_height":873,"full_width":570},{"listing_image_id":785668399,"hex_code":"000000","red":0,"green":0,"blue":0,"hue":0,"saturation":0,"brightness":0,"is_black_and_white":null,"creation_tsz":1434049504,"listing_id":236744966,"rank":4,"url_75x75":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/068\/0\/7502807\/il_75x75.785668399_rowg.jpg","url_170x135":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/068\/0\/7502807\/il_170x135.785668399_rowg.jpg","url_570xN":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/068\/0\/7502807\/il_570xN.785668399_rowg.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/068\/0\/7502807\/il_fullxfull.785668399_rowg.jpg","full_height":757,"full_width":570},{"listing_image_id":784323082,"hex_code":"000000","red":0,"green":0,"blue":0,"hue":0,"saturation":0,"brightness":0,"is_black_and_white":null,"creation_tsz":1434049504,"listing_id":236744966,"rank":5,"url_75x75":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/066\/0\/7502807\/il_75x75.784323082_e65w.jpg","url_170x135":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/066\/0\/7502807\/il_170x135.784323082_e65w.jpg","url_570xN":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/066\/0\/7502807\/il_570xN.784323082_e65w.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/066\/0\/7502807\/il_fullxfull.784323082_e65w.jpg","full_height":566,"full_width":570}],"Shop":{"shop_id":7502807,"shop_name":"BluebellandtheFox","user_id":26757783,"creation_tsz":1352945783,"title":"Bluebell and the Fox","announcement":"&quot;You have to live spherically - in many directions.

My pocket Scarves offer many diverse fabrics and most of them are available as cravats also, so long as I have enough fabric in stock. This fabric has been pre-washed for shrinkage. This ascot is approx. 42&quot; long and is pleated at the neck.\r\n\r\nI was drawn to the nautical and Romantic era aspect of this cotton print. This would make a stunning ascot with the right outfit. It really has such a Masterpiece Theatre quality to it and offers a modern twist for men&#39;s fashion.\r\n\r\nThis ascot\/cravat comes with a charming, self-produced post card with a little preamble about the pocket scarf.\r\n\r\nPlease read all shipping policies before purchase and if you live in a country outside of the USA familiarize yourself with your customs and excise taxes.\r\n\r\nA cravat is worn around the neck and tucked under a sweater or a shirt and were highly fashionable in plain colors and came in a variety of shapes and sizes. Like the pocket scarbes I enclose a post card with a little history of the neck scarf. It can be tied or folded over itself and wlll certainly keep a neck warmer than without. I&#39;m all for cozy! This unusual print adds an edgy modern twist and a tip of the hat for the old, in this redux vintage man&#39;s or woman&#39;s accessory. This cravat\/ascot is double sided and the fabric split so that the ravens stay upright and half are not upside down when wrapped around the neck. It is pleated in the back. \r\n\r\nSolid colors are also available.\r\n\r\nHand wash is advised, cold water. If placed in a washing bag this can be washed in the machine on cold, line dried and pressed with an iron.
