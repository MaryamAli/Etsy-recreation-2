Turnaround time to create and dispatch items is UP TO 12 days during the busier Christmas period and 7 days during the rest of the year.\r\n\r\nIMPORTANT : Postage time worldwide is usually approximately 15 to 25 days normal days but PLEASE NOTE, IT CAN TAKE LONGER : packages can take up to 6 weeks depending on the postal systems, please understand I am not responsible for any courier delays with your order as I post out as soon as possible, the variability in shipping time is attributed and up to the efficiency of postal services.\r\n\r\nI post registered mail with tracking (unless unregistered shipping is requested by the customer). This tracking number is to be used if your package is not received within the timeframe provided  as well as shows when the item was received , and is not to be used as a constant monitoring indicator of your package during scheduled delivery time. With registered mail, it requires someone to be at home at the time to provide a signature; if you would like the package to be sent unregistered so that the package is left at your residence without requirement of signature, just let me know in a note when you place your order. Please understand though that if a package is sent unregistered, there is no way of tracking it and therefore we cannot be responsible, and a subsequent refund cannot be issued.\r\n\r\nIn the case of LOST PACKAGES : I&#39;m not responsible for the lost items due to the postal service. I will do my best to communicate with the postal office in such a case on your behalf, if the package was sent registered. USPS has between 30 to 60 days to give a response after a claim is open by me and I can&#39;t do anything but wait.\r\nIf your package is not recieved within the timeframe provided by us, please contact your local post office, as it may have been returned due to nobody being present at the time of delivery, and the package will remain at your post office for around 3 weeks before being sent back to me.  \r\nYou are responsible for any additional customs charge and\/or local taxes, if and when applicable, so please check your local policies\/regulations on international packages.\r\n\r\nUNCLAIMED ITEMS : No refunds will be given for unclaimed items that are returned to us. If you would like the package to be sent back to you, you are to be responsible for the shipping costs\r\n\r\nEXPEDITED SHIPPING CAN BE ARRANGED : it costs a bit more for expedited shipping ($35 for 500g packages or less), so we dont include it in our normal item listings but if you would like to utilise this option, let us know prior to purchase and we can arrange it. The timeframe given by local post offices is 5-12 normal days for faster shipping.(Available Only for USA and Canada)\r\n","policy_refunds":"If you are not satisfied with my items, you will be fully refunded after I receive it, excluding shipping costs, please notify me within 48 hours after arrival.\r\n\r\nI will not be responsible for lost and damaged items sent by the standard service during the return.\r\n\r\nReturn shipping costs made by the buyer.

It is exquisitely crafted with a huge dangling cluster of hand-wired glistening faux baroque pearls that cascade down freely. The pin top is fashioned with a single big lustrous faux baroque pearl set in gold tone filigree metal that is adorned with numerous shimmering rhinestones in rich hues of green, blue and red. The base of the pin has a small gilded floral accent with a tiny faux pearl center and a single faux pearl drop. This gorgeous pin is certainly very unique, for it is undoubtedly one of the most ornate pins that I have come across by the designer! This spectacular piece is a classic example of Miriam Haskell&#39;s fine craftsmanship.\n\nThe pin measures 3 1\/4&quot; long. It is signed by the designer on the back.\n\nThis exquisite jewelry is in great vintage condition-the pearls have incredible luster, the rhinestones sparkle and the gold tone metal still retains its sheen.\n\nThis rare and fabulous designer jewelry is certainly heirloom worthy and will make a wonderful addition to any fine vintage collection!","creation_tsz":1444244436,"ending_tsz":1454875236,"original_creation_tsz":1423164329,"last_modified_tsz":1444244436,"price":"324.99","currency_code":"USD","quantity":1,"tags":["designer","vintage","scarf pin","brooch","rhinestones","pearls","gold tone","miiriam haskell","filigree","green","red","blue","baroque"],"category_path":["Jewelry","Brooch"],"category_path_ids":[68887482,69151689],"materials":[],"shop_section_id":16626825,"featured_rank":null,"state_tsz":1433615439,"url":"https:\/\/www.etsy.com\/listing\/221498505\/stunning-vintage-miriam-haskell-baroque?utm_source=theironyardteaching&utm_medium=api&utm_campaign=api","views":52,"num_favorers":4,"shipping_template_id":null,"processing_min":1,"processing_max":1,"who_made":"someone_else","is_supply":"false","when_made":"before_1996","item_weight":null,"item_weight_units":null,"item_length":null,"item_width":null,"item_height":null,"item_dimensions_unit":"in","is_private":false,"recipient":null,"occasion":null,"style":null,"non_taxable":false,"is_customizable":false,"is_digital":false,"file_data":"","language":"en-US","has_variations":false,"taxonomy_id":1201,"taxonomy_path":["Jewelry","Brooches"],"used_manufacturer":false,"Images":[{"listing_image_id":723049564,"hex_code":"53493F","red":83,"green":73,"blue":63,"hue":30,"saturation":24,"brightness":32,"is_black_and_white":false,"creation_tsz":1423164329,"listing_id":221498505,"rank":1,"url_75x75":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/059\/0\/9517567\/il_75x75.723049564_guz7.jpg","url_170x135":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/059\/0\/9517567\/il_170x135.723049564_guz7.jpg","url_570xN":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/059\/0\/9517567\/il_570xN.723049564_guz7.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/059\/0\/9517567\/il_fullxfull.723049564_guz7.jpg","full_height":579,"full_width":1125},{"listing_image_id":723049206,"hex_code":"A49786","red":164,"green":151,"blue":134,"hue":34,"saturation":18,"brightness":64,"is_black_and_white":false,"creation_tsz":1423164329,"listing_id":221498505,"rank":2,"url_75x75":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/056\/0\/9517567\/il_75x75.723049206_98iu.jpg","url_170x135":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/056\/0\/9517567\/il_170x135.723049206_98iu.jpg","url_570xN":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/056\/0\/9517567\/il_570xN.723049206_98iu.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/056\/0\/9517567\/il_fullxfull.723049206_98iu.jpg","full_height":703,"full_width":1187},{"listing_image_id":723174865,"hex_code":"746555","red":116,"green":101,"blue":85,"hue":31,"saturation":26,"brightness":45,"is_black_and_white":false,"creation_tsz":1423164329,"listing_id":221498505,"rank":3,"url_75x75":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/053\/0\/9517567\/il_75x75.723174865_lxbu.jpg","url_170x135":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/053\/0\/9517567\/il_170x135.723174865_lxbu.jpg","url_570xN":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/053\/0\/9517567\/il_570xN.723174865_lxbu.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img1.etsystatic.com\/053\/0\/9517567\/il_fullxfull.723174865_lxbu.jpg","full_height":898,"full_width":471},{"listing_image_id":723049062,"hex_code":"50453C","red":80,"green":69,"blue":60,"hue":27,"saturation":25,"brightness":31,"is_black_and_white":false,"creation_tsz":1423164329,"listing_id":221498505,"rank":4,"url_75x75":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/048\/0\/9517567\/il_75x75.723049062_qauw.jpg","url_170x135":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/048\/0\/9517567\/il_170x135.723049062_qauw.jpg","url_570xN":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/048\/0\/9517567\/il_570xN.723049062_qauw.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/048\/0\/9517567\/il_fullxfull.723049062_qauw.jpg","full_height":797,"full_width":1500},{"listing_image_id":723049380,"hex_code":"6F655E","red":111,"green":101,"blue":94,"hue":25,"saturation":15,"brightness":43,"is_black_and_white":false,"creation_tsz":1423164329,"listing_id":221498505,"rank":5,"url_75x75":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/047\/0\/9517567\/il_75x75.723049380_4nbw.jpg","url_170x135":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/047\/0\/9517567\/il_170x135.723049380_4nbw.jpg","url_570xN":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/047\/0\/9517567\/il_570xN.723049380_4nbw.jpg","url_fullxfull":"https:\/\/img0.etsystatic.com\/047\/0\/9517567\/il_fullxfull.723049380_4nbw.jpg","full_height":589,"full_width":1090}],"Shop":{"shop_id":9517567,"shop_name":"TyTimelessSparkles","user_id":30992341,"creation_tsz":1405199087,"title":"Vintage Designer Costume Jewelry","announcement":"Welcome to TyTimelessSparkles, a place for discerning collectors to find rare and beautiful designer vintage costume jewelry.
